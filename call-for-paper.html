    <h2 class="ml-2">Paper Submission Guidelines</h2>
    <div class="text pl-2">
        <p>All papers must be original and not simultaneously submitted to another journal or conference. A submission implies willingness by the authors to register and present their work if the paper is accepted for presentation at the conference. Accepted papers will be submitted for inclusion into <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/home.jsp" target="_blank">IEEE Xplore</a> subject to meeting IEEE Xplore's scope and quality requirements.</p>
        <p>Full Papers (between 5 and 8 pages) will be reviewed for acceptance in one or more of the following topics, typically involving some aspect of information, data or sensor fusion. Submitted papers must be formatted according to the IEEE Xplore template (A4 or Letter Size Paper), provided by IEEE <a href="https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html" target="_blank">here</a>, to be considered for acceptance and publication.</p>
        <p>Author guidelines</p>
        <ul class="listaSemIndicador listaLineHeight50">
            <li>A1 – Authors must submit their own original work only.</li>
            <li>A2 – Authors must not omit the main references done by others and related to their works.</li>
            <li>A3 – Authors must follow typesetting guidelines (templates) of the FUSION conference (<a href="https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html" target="_blank">see here</a>).</li>
            <li>A4 – Authors must agree with ISIF copyright agreement, once the paper is accepted for presentation.</li>
            <li>A5 – Authors must employ professional language and they must avoid excessive verbosity that would dilute the technical clarity.</li>
            <li>A6 – Authors must comply with the guidelines on the use and disclosure of content generated by artificial intelligence (AI) specified in the <a href="https://pspb.ieee.org/images/files/PSPB/opsmanual.pdf" target="_blank">IEEE Publication Services and Products Board Operations Manual</a>:
