    <div class="text pl-2">
        <p>The FUSION 2025 Organizing Committee is welcoming proposals for Special Sessions on the theory and application of information fusion. The purpose of special sessions is to stimulate a focused discussion on new or innovative topics. Of particular interest are proposals that address “breaking news” research or topics different from traditional fusion-related topics. Organizers of accepted special sessions will be asked to chair the session and will be consulted when finalizing the list of papers in the session.</p>

    <h2 class="ml-2">Proposal Requirements</h2>
    <div class="text pl-2">
        <p>Each special session proposal should include an overview of the topic that identifies its relevance and introduces the papers to be presented. This description will be made available in the proceedings. Each proposal should also include a list of committed papers.</p>
        <p>The following information must be included in a special session proposal:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Title of the proposed special session</li>
            <li>Names and affiliations of the organizers including brief bio and contact information
            </li>
            <li>Session abstract including the significance of the topic and the rationale for the proposed session
            </li>
            <li>List of committed papers including a tentative title, author list, and a short abstract for each paper. At least 5 papers are required.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <h2 class="ml-2">Evaluation Criteria</h2>
    <div class="text pl-2">
        <p>Special session proposals will be evaluated based on the timeliness of the topic, relevance to the field of information fusion, number of potential papers (assessed from the list of committed papers), and the qualifications of the organizers.  Once the proposal has been approved, it will be included among the sessions available for authors to submit their papers to.  All papers submitted to a special session will be reviewed through the same review process as the regular papers of the conference to ensure that contributions are of high quality.  If a special session has more papers accepted than the schedule can accommodate, some papers might be moved to other relevant sessions.</p>
