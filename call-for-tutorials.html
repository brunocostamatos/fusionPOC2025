This program should be useful to newcomers to the information fusion community to learn about the research achievements of the particular areas, as well as to currently active information fusion researchers who may be interested in widening their areas of research interest.</p>

    <h2 class="ml-2">Honorarium</h2>
    <div class="text pl-2">
        <p>The honorarium for tutorial speakers is made up of a basic amount plus a variable bonus. However, we will not offer any printing services and are not responsible for study materials distributed to the attendees. The bonus is directly taken from the tutorial fees and thus proportional to the number of attendees.</p>
